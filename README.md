# csvreader
Code for CSV file reader plugin for Selenium IDE

29 Oct 2021:
This was built for older version of selenium IDE where we had simple way of adding it as an external command.

Now this needs to be reworked and moved as a plugin not sure if the new versions of browser will still work on and external CSV file addition or not but I will try to figure out a way.


Hope this works!
